## Facts and challenges of Access Control <a name="step1"></a>

In the market, security and safety must be warranty with no compromise. Checking who is present in a particular location, at what time, are the childs are at home and back from school ? In the industrial area, protect people from critical devices is key. So to ensure security and safety, it is needed to perform sensing and report the information.

Sensing can be done through object detection or person detection with a powerful device and Microchip offers several solutions in that way. 
- Solutions with microprocessor such as [SAMA5D2](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/microcontrollers-and-microprocessors/32-bit-mpus/sama5/sama5d2-series) or [SAMA7G54](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/sama7g54)
- Solutions with FPGA such as [PolarFire](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas/polarfire-fpgas)

For this demo, we have selected the [PolarFire FPGA](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpgas/polarfire-fpgas) for sensing the persons and took benefit from the [PolarFire FPGA Video and Imaging Kit with MPF300T Device](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/MPF300-VIDEO-KIT-NS) with AI and ML capabilities.

Reporting the information can be done through different ways. And here we have selected to use wireless technology and the WBZ451 module for the capability to support Bluetooth Low Energy and Zigbee connectivity simultaneously.

</p>


### Use cases <a name="step2b"></a>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/UseCases.png" width=640>
</p>

#### Smart Home <a name="step2b1"></a>

Typical use case for Smart Home and illustrated by this demo: face recognition is required to open the garage door, disarm the home alarm and turn ON the lights.

#### Smart Building <a name="step2b2"></a>

For Smart Building, access control with a granted access could be required to enter into a building.

That enable another use case which is the energy management with a smart lighting system which turn ON the lights if a person is authorized to enter into the building.

#### Industry 4.0 <a name="step2b3"></a>

For Industrial plant, access control with recognition could be necessary to check if a person is authorized and if he has the requested equipment to operate on a machine. For example, the user must wear the helmet.

</p>

- The door itself

<p align="center">
<img src="images/Door.png" width=320>
</p>

#### Prepare the plexiglass for assembly

- On the bottom plexiaglass piece, you need to create spacer fixation for dsPIC33CK and WBZ451 boards. Moreover, you need to fix the vertical plexiglass piece through brackets. 
    - For WBZ451, drill 4 M2-holes and use M2-screws and M2-nuts to create spacers.
    - For dsPIC33CK, drill 4 M3-holes and use M3-screws and M3-nuts to create spacers.
    - To fix the bracket, drill 2 M3-holes and use M3-screws and M3-nuts to fix the brackets.
- The vertical plexiglass piece need to be fixed to the bottom plexiglass piece and to the top plexiglass piece through brackets.
    - On the top part, drill 3 M3-holes and use M3-screws and M3-nuts to fix the brackets.
    - On the bottom part, drill 2 M3-holes and use M3-screws and M3-nuts to fix the brackets.
- On the top piece, you need to fix the FPGA board through spacers, and you also need to fix it tho the vertical plexiglass piece.
    - To fix the FPGA, drill 4 M3-holes and use M3-screws (nuts is not required here, you can screw in the FPGA fixations).
    - Finaly, to fix the top piece to the vertical piece, drill 3 M3-holes and use M3-screws and M3-nuts to fix the brackets.

### Motor Setup <a name="step4c"></a>

Plug the coupling beam, the threaded rod then the black piece and the flange bearing. Then plug the coupling beam into the motorand fix the motor to the bottom plexiglass piece. You can adjust the motor to the size of the vertical piece with the space you leave betwee the motor and the threaded rod inside the coupling beam.

On the other side of the door plug the ball bearing into the black piece, then the smooth rod into the ball bearing and finaly into the flange bearing.

Once the door set up, you should fix the two flange bearing to the top plexiglass piece through long M3-screws and nuts.

- **[Reference Design](https://vector-blox-model-zoo.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Releases/VideoKit/vectorblox_videokit_v1.3.1.zip) for the PolarFire FPGA Video and Imaging Kit** (need to be updated with the new project to match this demo)

#### Demo customization

1. Download the [Libero® SoC 2021.3 Smart Camera Reference Design](https://vector-blox-model-zoo.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Releases/VideoKit/vectorblox_videokit_v1.3.1.zip) for the PolarFire FPGA Video and Imaging Kit

2. We will have to set an open drain output that we will connect to the WBZ45x Curiosity board. If the PolarFire recognize a person, the WBZ45x device will ask the motor control board to open the garage door. The state of the I/O will change and go from 0 to 1 while there is a person recognized by the system.

   a. Unzip and open the vectorblox_videokit_v1.3.1 project from the original [Reference Design](https://vector-blox-model-zoo.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Releases/VideoKit/vectorblox_videokit_v1.3.1.zip)

   b. Open the project using [Libero® SoC Design Suite 2021.3](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-later-versions)

   c. Modify CoreGPIO_OUT in PROC_SUBSYSTEM

   * Add 2 OUTPUT - in our case GPIO_OUT[6:5] and leave the settings by default</br></br><img src="images/MPF300_CoreGPIO_OUT.png" width=480>

   * Update PROC_SUBSYSTEM_0 and promote the new GPIO_OUTPUT to Top Level
   * As we want to have open drain outputs, please refer to cahpter 7.1.13 of the ["PolarFire FPGA and PolarFire SoC FPGA User I/O User Guide"](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/Microchip_PolarFire_FPGA_and_PolarFire_SoC_FPGA_User_IO_User_Guide_VC.pdf)
   </br></br><img src="images/MPF300_PROC_SUBSYSTEM.png" width=640>

   * You will then have to update the I/O Attributes. On the PolarFire Video Kit, we will use pins from the Display Connector J26. </br>
   So, we will connect our outputs as below:</br>
     - Connect OUT 1 to pin A2 of the PolarFire FPGA (Pin B1 of the Video Kit Display Port)
     - Connect OUT 2 to pin B4 of the PolarFire FPGA (Pin A1 of the Video Kit Display Port)
     - I/O Configuration:
        - Clamp = OFF
        - RES_PULL = NONE
        - Bank VDDI = 2.5V
        
   </br></br><img src="images/MPF300_IO_Configuration.png" width=720>

   Your project is now ready, you should be able to RUN the project.

3. We will now modify the Software in SoftConsole

   a. In *main.c*, you will need to define OUT1 & OUT2

   ```
   #define OUT1 GPIO_5
   #define OUT2 GPIO_6
   ```

   b. Then, setup the GPIOs as output

   ```
   GPIO_set_output(&g_gpio_out, OUT1, 1) ;
   GPIO_set_output(&g_gpio_out, OUT2, 1) ;
   ```

   c. In the file *faceDetectDemo.c*, set the custom GPIOs to 0 if there is a similarity and face recognized
   </br></br><img src="images/MPF300_GPIO_SET_TO_ZERO.png" width=640>

   d. Then, in the file *faceDetectDemo.c*, set the output back to 1 when the program is starting to scale a new frame
   </br></br><img src="images/MPF300_GPIO_SET_TO_ONE.png" width=320>

   Your software is now modified.


#### Setting-up the image database for Face Recognition

1. The project is already running the face recognition Demo using the existing Image Database as created by the VectorBlox-SDK at the following Link. </br> [https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/tree/master/example/python/faceDemo/dbImages](https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/tree/master/example/python/faceDemo/dbImages)

2. To detect known faces in the surroundings through Videokit, the Image Database in the project must be updated with the new Images. To update the Image Database, one need to be able to execute examples and tutorials for VectorBlox-SDK Release 1.3. </br> To setup the VectorBlox-SDK following steps must be followed.</br>  [https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK](https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK)

3. Download the [VectorBlox-SDK release 1.3.0](https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/releases/tag/release-v1.3.0)

4. Change the permissions of the copied folder using:</br> 
```sudo chmod -R 777 VectorBlox-SDK-release-v1.3.0/```

5. Follow the below steps</br>
```
cd VectorBlox-SDK-release-v1.3.0/
sudo bash
```
(Note: remember executing the scripts in the SDK requires switching to bash)
```
bash install_dependencies.sh
source setup_vars.sh
```

6. Before updating the database, follow the below steps</br>
[https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/blob/master/app_notes/updating_face_recognition_database.md#preparing-models](https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/blob/master/app_notes/updating_face_recognition_database.md#preparing-models)
```
cd $VBX_SDK/tutorials/mxnet/mobilefacenet-arcface
bash mobilefacenet-arcface.sh
```
(Before creating the Database step, the known Images should be copied to the following folder of WSL ubuntu)

*C:\Users\MXXXXX\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04LTS_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\username\VectorBlox-SDK-release-v1.3.0\example\python\faceDemo\dbImages*

(Note: only images in .png and .jpg format are accepted)


7. Issue the following commands to update the Database</br>
[https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/blob/master/app_notes/updating_face_recognition_database.md](https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/blob/master/app_notes/updating_face_recognition_database.md)

```
cd example/python/faceDemo/
python createdDb.py
python exportDb.py
```

(Note: python processImage.py command throws errors, but it is not required as it is only a sanity check on the added Images which is not working in this release. In addition, the steps to update the Database are described on the following link as well.)


8. Copy the code generated in *C:\Users\MXXXXX\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04LTS_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\username\VectorBlox-SDK-release-v1.3.0\example\python\faceDemo\faceDb.c* to the following .c file of the SoftConsole Project: *C:\Users\ MXXXXX\Downloads\vectorblox_videokit_v1.3\softconsole\Videokit\faceDetection\faceDetectDemo.c*. </br>
Copy the entire code from the generated file *faceDb.c* and replace the corresponding code in *faceDetectDemo.c* from the SoftConsole Project starting at the line number 79</br>
```
#define DB_LENGTH 79
#define EMBEDDING_LENGTH 128
```

9. Build the SoftConsole Project and one should be able to run the Demo with updated Database through FlashPro Interface. The Project can be built in Release Mode. Debug Mode build shows error which must be fixed. Release Mode is good enough to run the Demo

10. To run the Demo without Debug Interface, updated SoftConsole Project hex file should replace the existing FabricRAM hex file in the Libero SoC Project. For further details about how to program the FPGA and SPI Flash with the updated files, refer to the Section 5.2.2 in the below document.</br>

### Cloud Setup <a name="step4h"></a>

#### Amazon Echo setup

- Power on the amazon echo and download the Alexa app on your smartphone.
- Then, open Alexa app and under *add device* section, select *echo*. 
- On your Echo, enter configuration mode by pressing the action switch during 10 seconds.
- Then on the app, enter your access point SSID and password to configure your Echo.

#### WBZ451 provisionning

Once the Echo is configured, you can provision your WBZ451 device by asking *Alexa, discover my devices* or in the app by adding a device, selecting *light*.

In the same time, on Microchip Bluetooth Data app, enter *BLE commissioning* section, launch a scan to find your WBZ451.

Once the device selected, you can change the name and provision it.

Start the provisionning and wait for 30 to 45 seconds.

If the Echo found your WBZ451, it will automatically register it in the Alexa app as a light. Then you can go into *Device* select the new device and rename it *Garage door*.

#### Add a Philips Hue light

- Plug the Philips Hue bulbe into the light. 
- Then discover the devices, the Philips light should slowly blink. 
- Once the provisionning finished, the light should stay on. 
- Then go into the Alexa app, into *Devices* section select *Light* and rename the new one *Philips light*. 

#### Alexa routine

On the Alexa app go into *Other* tab and select *Routines*. Create 4 new routines :

- The first one is to open the door:
    - Rename the routine *Open garage door*
    - As input select *voice* and write down *Open garage door*.
    - As action select *Home*, then *Light*, then *Garage door* and hit *next*. On the new section select *On* and validate.
    - Add another action, select *Home*, then *Light*, then *Philips light* and hit *next*. On the new section select *Off* and validate.

- The second one is to close the door:
    - Rename the routine *Close garage door*
    - As input select *voice* and write down *Close garage door*.
    - Add another input, select *voice* and write down *Turn on Garage light*.
    - As action select *Home*, then *Light*, then *Garage door* and hit *next*. On the new section select *Off* and validate.
    - Add another action, select *Home*, then *Light*, then *Philips light* and hit *next*. On the new section select *On* and validate.

- The third one is to turn on the light:
    - Rename the routine *turn on garage light*
    - As input select *voice* and write down *turn on garage light*.
    - As action select *Home*, then *Light*, then *Garage door* and hit *next*. On the new section select *Off* and validate.
    - Add another action, select *Home*, then *Light*, then *Philips light* and hit *next*. On the new section select *On* and validate.

- The forth one is to turn off the light:

## Run the demo <a name="step5"></a>

To lauch the demo, follow these steps :

- Turn ON the FPGA board with the ON/OFF switch close to the power supply connector.
- Go on Alexa app, make sure that the garage door is OFF (closed position).
- Then, reset the WBZ451, application LED should be OFF. 
- And reset the dsPIC33CK LVMC, if the door was not close, it should automatically close it.

To trigger the door with face recognition feature, just pass in front of the camera.

The vocal commands to trigger the door through Alexa are:

- Alexa, open garage door
- Alexa, close garage door
- Alexa, turn on garage light
- Alexa, turn off garage light

To trigger the door via your smartphone:

- Launch Microchip Bluetooth Data App
- Go in the BLE sensor section, select PIC32CX-BZ2 then scan to find the WBZ451 device
- Select the device that appear on the screen and now you can trigger it through BLE using the switch on the app.

Use the visual indicators to monitor the behavior of the demo:

- On WBZ451 Curiosity Board:
   - Blue LED: indicate connection status ("Off" when connected).
   - RGB LED: application LED.
- On dsPIC33CK LVMC:
   - 6 green LEDs in a row: indicate the motor status ("On" when motor is running).
   - LED 10: indicate that the dsPIC has receive a UP command. Turn off when the door reach the top position.
   - LED 11: indicate that the dsPIC has receive a DOWN command.Turn off when the door reach the bottom position.
- On MPF300:
   - On the screen, there is green squares when a person is recognized and blue squares when a the person is not recognized.

HMI:

- On WBZ451:
   - Reset switch: left one when looking at the back of the door.
   - Application switch: right one when looking at the back of the door.
- On dsPIC33CK LVMC:
   - Reset switch : in the center of the board.
- On MPF300:
   - On/Off switch: close to power supply connector.

## FAQ <a name="step6"></a>

Here is the list of known issues:

- The motor can have difficulties to go up. If the motor stop between the up and down position, either LED10 or LED11 will remain on. In this case the motor can receive any other command, you should perform a reset.
- WBZ451 may lost ZigBee or BLE connection. In this case, you should perform a reset.
- Sometime, after several usage of the door, the motor may fail (wrong direction or no start at all). It is recommended to perform a reset every 10 demo cycles.
- After several Hours running, the FPGA may overheat, in this case the screen will freeze. The FPGA will need to be rebooted with the on/off switch next to the power supply connector. 

Reset procedure:

- On Alexa app, make sure that the garage door is Off (Closed position).
- Reset the WBZ451, application LED should be Off.
- Reset the dsPIC33CK LVMC, if the door was not close, it should automatically close it.

Possible improvement items:

- Implement bidirectional communication (e.g. UART) between WBZ451 Curiosity board and the dsPIC33CK to improve reliability of the demo
- Review the motor state machine and make it more robust to not miss direction changes after several cycles
- Make the mechanical parts of the demo more robust to reduce vibration and improve the door alignment during the go up and go down phases
